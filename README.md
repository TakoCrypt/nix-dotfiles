# My simple nix-darwin & NixOS configuration

This is my dead-simple configuration. Maybe something to take inspiration from if you're trying to get set up with
your own cross-platform NixOS, WSL, and nix-darwin configuration!

## To do

- I use Alacritty on Windows (not because I want to, I just haven't bothered setting up WezTerm properly). The configuration can be managed by home-manager too, although I'm not 100% sure that's a good idea.
- Need to configure my Mac's dock and Finder settings

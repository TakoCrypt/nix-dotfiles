# clo4's grug-brained NixOS configuration

This is my dead-simple configuration. I'm not showing my gigabrain's true power, not trying to make you go "wow he's so smart" with my
usage of wacky FP shit. I just have a few systems that I want to configure, and have a simple structure to do that with.

If you're trying to set up your own NixOS, WSL or nix-darwin configuration, this may be a good place to take inspiration. Each of the top-level
directories has a README that explains what is contained within it, and each of the files is documented pretty well.

## To do

- I use Alacritty on Windows (not because I want to, I just haven't bothered setting up WezTerm properly). The configuration can be managed by home-manager too, although I'm not 100% sure that's a good idea.
